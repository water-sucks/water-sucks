### Eternally Tired.

Yet another developer from out of the woodworks, up at odd times doing who knows
what. I also play drums.

I like playing around with:

-   Nix/NixOS
-   Neovim
-   Zig

Currently studying computer science at [San Francisco State University](https://sfsu.edu).

Other stuff I like:

-   Drums
-   [Music](https://last.fm/user/water-sucks)
-   Football ([RN4L](https://www.raiders.com/history/the-autumn-wind))
