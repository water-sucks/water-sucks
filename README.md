### Eternally Tired.

Yet another developer from out of the woodworks, up at odd times doing who knows
what. I also play drums.

I like playing around with:

- Nix/NixOS
- Neovim

Currently studying computer science at [Ohlone College](https://ohlone.edu).

Other stuff I like:

- Drums
- [Music](https://last.fm/user/water-sucks)
- Football ([RN4L](https://www.raiders.com/history/the-autumn-wind))
